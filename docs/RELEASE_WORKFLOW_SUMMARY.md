# GitHub Actions Release Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for building multi-platform binaries and creating automated releases. The workflow builds binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux, then reuses those artifacts to build Docker images efficiently.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/release.yml`
Main release workflow that:
- **Builds binaries** for 5 platforms (Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64, Windows amd64)
- **Generates attestations** for supply chain security
- **Creates GitHub Releases** with auto-generated notes and checksums
- **Builds Docker images** reusing the Linux binaries (no rebuild)

### 2. `Dockerfile.release`
Optimized Dockerfile that:
- Uses pre-built binaries from the workflow
- Supports multi-architecture builds (amd64/arm64)
- Avoids rebuilding Go code
- Results in smaller, faster Docker builds

### 3. `docs/RELEASE.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Release process workflow
- How to create releases
- Verification steps
- Attestation verification
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations

## Files Removed

### 1. `.github/workflows/docker.yml`
- Removed as Docker builds are now handled by the release workflow
- Eliminates redundancy and simplifies CI/CD pipeline
- Docker images are only built on releases (when tags are pushed)

## Files Modified

### 1. `cmd/server/main.go`
- Added version variable with build-time injection
- Supports `-X main.version=` linker flag
- Falls back to config if version not set at build time

### 2. `Makefile`
- Added `release-build` target for local multi-platform builds
- Helps test release builds locally before pushing

### 3. `README.md`
- Added "Download Pre-Built Binaries" section
- Links to releases page
- Shows example download and verification
- Links to release documentation

## How It Works

### Release Trigger
Push a tag matching `v*` pattern:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Workflow Execution

1. **Build Binaries Job** (Parallel)
   - Matrix strategy builds all 5 platform binaries simultaneously
   - Each binary is trimmed, stripped, and versioned
   - Attestations are generated for each binary
   - Artifacts are uploaded for next jobs

2. **Create Release Job** (After binaries)
   - Downloads all binary artifacts
   - Generates SHA256 checksums
   - Creates GitHub Release with:
     - Auto-generated release notes
     - All binaries attached
     - Checksums file

3. **Build Docker Job** (After binaries, parallel with release)
   - Downloads Linux amd64 and arm64 binaries
   - Uses Dockerfile.release to build images
   - **Reuses binaries** - no Go compilation
   - Builds multi-arch images
   - Pushes to ghcr.io with multiple tags

**Note**: Docker images are only built on releases. No continuous Docker builds on main branch pushes.

## Key Features

### Multi-Platform Support
- Linux: amd64, arm64
- macOS: amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- Windows: amd64

### Supply Chain Security
- Artifact attestations for all binaries
- Verifiable with GitHub CLI
- Reproducible builds

### Efficiency
- Docker builds reuse Go binaries
- No duplicate compilation
- Parallel job execution
- Build cache optimization

### Automation
- Auto-generated release notes
- Automatic versioning
- Multiple Docker tags (semver + latest)
- Checksums for verification

## Docker Tag Strategy

For tag `v1.2.3`, creates:
- `ghcr.io/guigui42/mcp-vosdroits:1.2.3`
- `ghcr.io/guigui42/mcp-vosdroits:1.2`
- `ghcr.io/guigui42/mcp-vosdroits:1`
- `ghcr.io/guigui42/mcp-vosdroits:latest`

## Verification

Users can verify binaries:
```bash
# Download binary and checksums
curl -LO https://github.com/guigui42/mcp-vosdroits/releases/download/v1.0.0/mcp-vosdroits-linux-amd64
curl -LO https://github.com/guigui42/mcp-vosdroits/releases/download/v1.0.0/checksums.txt

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c checksums.txt 2>&1 | grep linux-amd64

# Verify attestation
gh attestation verify mcp-vosdroits-linux-amd64 -R guigui42/mcp-vosdroits
```

## Benefits

1. **For Users**:
   - Pre-built binaries for all major platforms
   - No need to compile from source
   - Verified, secure downloads
   - Multiple installation options

2. **For Maintainers**:
   - Fully automated releases
   - Consistent build process
   - No manual steps
   - Complete audit trail

3. **For Docker**:
   - Faster builds (reuses binaries)
   - Multi-arch support
   - Automatic versioning
   - Optimized image size

## Testing

Local testing before release:
```bash
# Build all platforms locally
make release-build

# Check binaries
ls -lh bin/release/

# Test a binary
./bin/release/mcp-vosdroits-darwin-arm64
```

## Next Steps

To create your first release:

1. **Verify CI passes** on main branch
2. **Create and push a tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
3. **Monitor workflow** in GitHub Actions
4. **Verify release** page has all artifacts
5. **Test Docker image** pull

## Security Notes

- All builds run in GitHub-hosted runners (clean environment)
- Attestations provide cryptographic proof of provenance
- No secrets required (uses GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Docker images run as non-root user
- Binaries are statically linked (no external dependencies)

## Workflow Permissions

The release workflow requires:
- `contents: write` - Create releases
- `packages: write` - Push Docker images
- `id-token: write` - Generate attestations
- `attestations: write` - Store attestations

These are properly configured in the workflow file.
